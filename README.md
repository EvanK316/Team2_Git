## Abstract
The data is examining the  access to oppurtunies based on different modes of transportation. These access to oppurtunities include job access, spatial mispatch, libraries, and hospitals. We are observing 4 cities: Seattle, Lansing, Baltimore, and Nashville. Currently our group will be seeking to answer if there is correlation between race, education and spatial mismatch based off city.
